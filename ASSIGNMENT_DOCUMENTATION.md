## Part 1: Development Log (1 mark)

Document your development process with **minimum 3 entries** showing progression:

### Entry 1 - [2026/5/5, 11:12 PM]
**What I implemented**: Forked the repo, changed student ID to 445052075. 

**Challenges encountered**: No challenges, pretty straightforward.

**How I solved it**: Followed the VS Code cloning steps.

**Testing approach**: Ran the original code to see the race conditions – numbers were different every time.

**Time spent**: 20 min.

---

### Entry 2 - [2026/5/5, 11:34 PM]
**What I implemented**: Added ReentrantLock to protect shared variables (contextSwitchCount, completedProcessCount, totalWaitingTime) and wrapped them using lock/unlock with try-finally.

**Challenges encountered**: I was a bit confused where exactly to place the locks and how many locks I should use (one lock or multiple locks).

**How I solved it**: I followed the hint in the code and used separate locks for each variable to allow better concurrency. Also made sure to use try-finally to avoid deadlock.

**Testing approach**: Ran the program multiple times and checked if the counters are now consistent.

**Time spent**: 45 min.

---

### Entry 3 - [2026/5/6, 12:25 AM]
**What I implemented**: Added ReentrantLock for executionLog (ArrayList) to prevent concurrent modification issues.

**Challenges encountered**: I wasn’t sure if ArrayList really needs synchronization since it worked before sometimes.

**How I solved it**: After reading the assignment, I understood that multiple threads can access it at the same time, so I added a lock to protect add operations.

**Testing approach**: Ran the program several times and ensured no errors or inconsistent log sizes appear.

**Time spent**: 30 min.

---

### Entry 4 - [2026/5/6, 12:55 AM]
**What I implemented**: Added a binary Semaphore for CPU access control by defining cpuSemaphore = new Semaphore(1) in the shared resources.

**Challenges encountered**: I was initially unsure what value to use for the semaphore and how it controls process execution.

**How I solved it**: I used a binary semaphore (1 permit) as required in the assignment to ensure only one process can access the CPU at a time.

**Testing approach**: Ran the program multiple times and confirmed that only one process executes at a time and results are consistent.

**Time spent**: 45 min.

## Part 2: Technical Questions (1 mark)

### Question 1: Race Conditions
**Q**: Identify and explain TWO race conditions in the original code. For each:
- What shared resource is affected?
- Why is concurrent access a problem?
- What incorrect behavior could occur?

**Your Answer**:

[Your answer here - 4-6 sentences with code examples]

---

### Question 2: Locks vs Semaphores
**Q**: Explain the difference between ReentrantLock and Semaphore. Where did you use each in your code and why?

**Your Answer**:

[Your answer here - explain your implementation choices]

---

### Question 3: Deadlock Prevention
**Q**: What is deadlock? Explain TWO prevention techniques and what you did to prevent deadlocks in your code.

**Your Answer**:

[Your answer here - reference try-finally blocks, lock ordering, etc.]

---

### Question 4: Lock Granularity Design Decision 
**Q**: For Task 1 (protecting the three counters), explain your lock design choice:
- Did you use ONE lock for all three counters (coarse-grained) OR separate locks for each counter (fine-grained)?
- Explain WHY you made this choice
- What are the trade-offs between the two approaches?
- Given that the three counters are independent, which approach provides better concurrency and why?

**Your Answer**:

[Your answer here - explain coarse-grained vs fine-grained locking, independence of counters, concurrency implications. Show understanding of when to use each approach. 5-8 sentences expected.]
